# Triav1lity


## ARCHIVE NOTE
This project ended up never really happening.
The bash script client in here is a much better version of the client bash script in the prototype project for this [AV1Master](https://github.com/dali99/AV1Master)
And it is compatible and will work just fine with AV1Master. You probably shouldn't be using AV1Master either though. Instead have a look at [grav1_ex](https://github.com/wwww-wwww/grav1_ex) the modern version of the competing product at the time


Sequel to AV1Master, alternative to grav1

Aims to extend and implement grav1's API in addition to improving upon the AV1Master API so that it is compatible with the grav1's webui and grav1c

Uses async rocket and stores state.
